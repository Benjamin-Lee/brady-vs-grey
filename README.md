Brady vs. Grey


To make sure that my API key was not published, I separated it into a text file and used .gitignore to ensure that it wasn't publshed.

If you wish to create your own version of this, make a file entitled "api_key.txt" and put it in the same directory as "youtube_integration.py"

Enjoy!
